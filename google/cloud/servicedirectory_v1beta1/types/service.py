    r"""An individual service. A service contains a name and optional
    metadata. A service must exist before
    [endpoints][google.cloud.servicedirectory.v1beta1.Endpoint] can be
    added to it.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Immutable. The resource name for the service in the format
            ``projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*``
        metadata (Sequence[~.service.Service.MetadataEntry]):
            Optional. Metadata for the service. This data
            can be consumed by service clients.  The entire
            metadata dictionary may contain up to 2000
            characters, spread across all key-value pairs.
            Metadata that goes beyond any these limits will
            be rejected.
        endpoints (Sequence[~.endpoint.Endpoint]):
            Output only. Endpoints associated with this
            service. Returned on LookupService.Resolve.
            Control plane clients should use
            RegistrationService.ListEndpoints.
