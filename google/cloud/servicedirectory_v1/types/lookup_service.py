    Looks up a service by its name, returns the service and its
    endpoints.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The name of the service to resolve.
        max_endpoints (int):
            Optional. The maximum number of endpoints to
            return. Defaults to 25. Maximum is 100. If a
            value less than one is specified, the Default is
            used. If a value greater than the Maximum is
            specified, the Maximum is used.
        endpoint_filter (str):
            Optional. The filter applied to the endpoints of the
            resolved service.

            General filter string syntax: () can be "name" or
            "metadata." for map field. can be "<, >, <=, >=, !=, =, :".
            Of which ":" means HAS and is roughly the same as "=". must
            be the same data type as the field. can be "AND, OR, NOT".

            Examples of valid filters:

            -  "metadata.owner" returns Endpoints that have a label with
               the key "owner", this is the same as "metadata:owner"
            -  "metadata.protocol=gRPC" returns Endpoints that have
               key/value "protocol=gRPC"
            -  "metadata.owner!=sd AND metadata.foo=bar" returns
               Endpoints that have "owner" field in metadata with a
               value that is not "sd" AND have the key/value foo=bar.
